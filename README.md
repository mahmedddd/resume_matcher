# Resume Matcher

Resume Matcher is an AI-powered tool that helps job seekers improve their resumes by matching them against job descriptions.  
It uses embeddings to analyze both resumes and job postings, highlighting key skills and improving match scores for better hiring chances.

````

- **data/**: Contains datasets (cleaned and raw job descriptions)  
- **model/**: Pretrained job embedding model (`job_embedding.pt`)  
- **src/**: Source code modules for matching and parsing  
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies  

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmedddd/resume_matcher.git
cd resume_matcher
````

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset and Model

Download the dataset and pre-trained model files from this Google Drive link:

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s-wY3jacmRijOnE3WFNDLJlPkYOv-9U6/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s-wY3jacmRijOnE3WFNDLJlPkYOv-9U6/view?usp=sharing)

Place the downloaded files in the appropriate folders inside the repo (`data/` for datasets and `model/` for the model).

## Usage

Run the matcher script to compare your resume with job descriptions:

```bash
python src/matcher.py --resume path/to/your_resume.txt --job_desc path/to/job_description.txt
```
